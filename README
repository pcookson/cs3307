Group 6 Bank compilation instructions
=====================================

Our project uses MySql.  We ran this on a Ubuntu 14.04 server.

Above and beyond a robust GNU implementation (make, g++, stl, etc.), the 
following packages are required.

mysql
libmysqlclient

To get these on Ubuntu:

# <--- means you must execute as root
$ <--- means can be executed as a regular user
> <--- means a mysql command

# apt-get install mysql
# apt-get install libmysqlclient

$ mysql -u root -p
> create database group6
> quit

$ mysql -u root -p group6 < sql/db.sql

Next edit the src/config.h file and enter your database connection information.
If you uncomment the two lines at the top under the define guard, our program
will print verbose sql information.

To compile, change directory to the src folder
$ make

To run the program type, from inside the src directory type:
./mainApp/bank

The only thing left is to give us 108%. :)
